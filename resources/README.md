- [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders: Launch](https://www.fast.ai/2018/09/26/ml-launch/) by fast.ai

## Tools
### Machine Learning
- [dvc - Open-source Version Control System for Machine Learning Projects](https://dvc.org/) - Git-compatible, storage-agnostic (for data storage), reproducible, 

- [Quilt](https://quiltdata.com/)
Create a library of data! [How to run Quilt Registry using Docker](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt/blob/c776cd455ad0c300700b669a904951f91ca91640/registry/README.md)


### Python
- [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/) - Data validation and settings management using python type hinting
- [Flake8: Your Tool For Style Guide Enforcement](http://flake8.pycqa.org/)
"Flake8 is a Python library that wraps **PyFlakes**, **pycodestyle** and **Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script**. It is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8), programming errors (like “library imported but unused” and “Undefined name”) and to check cyclomatic complexity." - [How to use Flake8](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/packages/2016/08/05/flake8.html)


- [Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
"A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work"

#### Development and Packaging
- [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
